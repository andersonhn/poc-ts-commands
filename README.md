# POC: Commands

It demonstrates two approaches to how to rollback a series of commands executed.

For example, if the application needs to create a job offer then assign it to a company, but the assignment instruction fails the job offer is deleted.

This specification is implemented using an [Object Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) approach based on [Command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) and using an approach based on [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) (FP) principles.
